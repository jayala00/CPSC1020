1.) This project was a lot more easier to do in my opinion. I finished the
    majority of the filters 4 days after we were assigned the project. The
    main issues I had were with the Binary filter and also making the vector
    of Filter*. After fixing the problem, I ran into another issue when we were
    assigned a different image to use rather than the puppy image I was using
    from the beginning. Since the new tiger image was a rectangle, my loops
    that ran through each pixel were not set to take into consideration
    column and row sizes. Also, I had minor trouble with the sepia extra
    credit.

2.) With my first issue with the binary filter, I was having trouble figuring
    out a way to make sure I have the 2 pixel colors implemented. To fix this,
    I got help from Nick and he explained to try manually putting the values
    of the 2 pixel colors in the constructor of the binary filter as well as
    making two protected variable of Pixel in the binary filter class. With
    the issue of my loops that ran through the pixels of the new image, I just
    played with the way the loops ran until my image came out the right way.
    My issue with the sepia extra credit was that at the end of my function, I
    was not multiplying my RGB values with 255.0, to make up for the fact that
    I divided them by 255.0 at the beginning of the function.

3.) Overall, I really enjoyed this project. I found it very entertaining and
    fun making the different filters for our images and also enjoyed having
    our last combination of filter style to be of whatever combination.
    I would've finished this programing assignment much earlier if my
    PA2 partner had not decided to work on the assignment individually this
    time around. Regardless, I finished it with no rush.
